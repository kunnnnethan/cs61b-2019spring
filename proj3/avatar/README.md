### final project from [CS 61B Data Structures, Spring 2019](https://sp19.datastructur.es)

### Setting

You have to add all the .jar files inside javalib directory into your SDKs in order to run the packages that I imported from [here](https://introcs.cs.princeton.edu/java/stdlib/).

> **For IntelliJ:** </br>
> File-> Project Structure-> Platform Settings-> SDKs
(Simply press plus buttom and choose those files.)

### How to play it

In the beginning, you are locked in a dark room full of alleys. You have to find the door and get your way out.
<br/>

You can either try to find the door directly without light source or find the light source first to get a better view.
<br/>

Always be aware of that there is a monster chasing after you.
<br/>

Now you can go and have fun!
